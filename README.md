This is a warming excercice in C++. You're getting a broken c++ program, you will work to make it work by following the instructions below.

- The program must be compiled with the `make` command
- As much as possible, follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- Add the required documentation (in the code), so it can be understood by any new programmer
- Finally, update the [Description of the program](#description-of-the-program) section with a brief description of what this program is doing.
- Once you're done, commit and push your changes
